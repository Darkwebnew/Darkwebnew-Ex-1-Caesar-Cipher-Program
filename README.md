# Ex-1-Caesar-Cipher

## AIM:
To encrypt and decrypt the given message by using Ceaser Cipher encryption algorithm.

## DESIGN STEPS:
Step 1: Design of Caeser Cipher algorithnm

Step 2: Implementation using C or pyhton code

Step 3:

  --In Ceaser Cipher each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

  --For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. 
  
  --The encryption can also be represented using modular arithmetic by first transforming the letters into numbers, according to the scheme, A = 0, B = 1, Z = 25.
  
  --Encryption of a letter x by a shift n can be described mathematically as, En(x) = (x + n) mod26
  
  --Decryption is performed similarly, Dn (x)=(x - n) mod26
